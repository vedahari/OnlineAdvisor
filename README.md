###Abstract:
######Idling, or running the engine when the vehicle is not moving, accounts for 13%-23% of vehicle driving time and costs billions of gallons of fuel each year. In this paper, we consider the problem of idling reduction under the uncertainty of vehicle stop time. We abstract it as a classic ski rental problem, and propose a constrained version with two statistics Î¼B- and qB+, the expected length of short stops and the probability of long stops. We develop two online algorithms, a suboptimal closed-form algorithm and an optimal numerical solution, that combine the best of the well-known deterministic and randomized schemes to minimize the worst case competitive ratio. We demonstrate the algorithms perform better than existing solutions in terms of both worst case guarantee and average case performance using simulation and real-world driving data.
